-----------------

Tools for measurements in real-time pipelines.

 - throughput: measure wallclock-throughput of a point in the pipeline in frames,
   samples, buffers, bytes or bits per second.

 - shift: shift timestamps of buffers by a defined amount to see, if a muxer
   or another combining element can handle that and put things back together correctly
